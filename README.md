This program is that lets a user play the hangman game using GUI.

- A user guesses a word, which is from a text file, by entering one letter at a time.
- If the user misses seven times, a hanging man swings.
- Once a word is finished, the user can press the Enter key to continue to guess another word.
- Words consist only of letters without numbers or symbols.
- Even if a user presses a key other than a letter, it will not affect the game, except for pressing the enter key to continue the game.
